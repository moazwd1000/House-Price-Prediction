🏠 House Price Prediction using XGBoost

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features using the XGBoost algorithm. The model is trained and evaluated on a structured dataset and demonstrates strong performance in capturing pricing trends.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the price of houses. We use XGBoost, a powerful and efficient gradient boosting framework, known for its speed and performance on structured data.

📊 Model Performance

The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data.

✅ Training Results:
R² Score: 0.999998

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0091

🧪 Testing Results:
R² Score: 0.90517

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.0749


📈 These results indicate the model fits the training data almost perfectly and generalizes well on the test data with minor error margins.
